Hey guys!

>> I made this while I was learning the requests module.

>> I learnt how to do auth stuff then I thought, why not have a big file of usernames and passwords and the 
code can use it to do auth in weak websites which allow multiple auths

>>This is just a basic code and I am thinking of randomly using a username with all the passwords available
but that will increase the time taken. Let's see what happens.  :)
